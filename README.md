# InGrid

A responsive fluid grid framework with fixed margins, and some pre-defined layout models.

Ingrid's foundation can be found in [Bootstrap's grid component](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid), but is extended with layout modes that are inspired from [Mueller Gridsystem](http://muellergridsystem.com/).

# Using InGrid

Either run and compile InGrid in it's stand-alone directory, or include ```ingrid.scss``` in your main ```.scss-file```.
